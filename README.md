# amazon_music_clustering
This project focuses on unsupervised learning to cluster songs based on their audio features using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By analyzing musical attributes such as danceability, energy, tempo, and acousticness, the project identifies patterns and groups similar songs together.

The goal is to understand how songs can be grouped into distinct clusters based on their sound characteristics, which can be useful for music recommendation systems, playlist generation, and music analytics.
